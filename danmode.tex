{\Large \textbf{Notes (English):}\par}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Danish vowels Æ, Ø, and Å: \Ttelco\TTinvertedthreedots\Ts
  \Ttelco\TTdoubleacute ~and \Taara\TTthreedots, respectively.  The
  first two follow the example of the German and Swedish modes.  The Å
  reflects the pre-1948 orthography of writing the letter as Aa.  Note
  that even then, aa was considered a distinct vowel alphabetized at
  the end of the alphabet.  The long carrier (\'ara) should not be
  used for other purposes.  Y is always a vowel.  The german letter
  \"u sometimes appears in names, and can be written as in the German
  mode \Ttelco\TTtwodots ~or as y \Ttelco\TTbreve ~according to
  taste.\label{notevokal}
\item The vowel combination ue can be two distinct vowels written as
  such, or the e can be silent and be written with the e-dot below: \emph{due}
  \Tando\Ttelco\TTleftcurl\Ttelco\TTacute ~(pigeon) but
  \emph{vindue}
  \Tampa\Tando\TTnasalizer\TTdot\Ttelco\TTleftcurl\TTdotbelow
  ~(window).
\item Two juxtaposed vowels are usually just that in Danish, but in
  the few cases where it is a diphthong they can be 
  written as in the English mode.
\item D is pronounced in three equally common ways: the ``hard d''
  ([d], clearly ando \Tando), the ``soft d'' (\textipa{[D]}, clearly anto \Tanto), and the
  ``silent d'', which I suggest writing as extended ando
  \Textendedando.\label{noteD}
\item G can also be ``hard'' or ``soft''.  Whereas the ``hard g'' is
  close to the same sound in English (ungw\"e \Tungwe), the so-called
  soft g is an ill-defined continuum of weak sounds reaching from
  completely silent, over semivowels \textipa{[I]} and \textipa{[U]},
  to an sh \textipa{[S]} in loan words from English or French, where
  we attempt to preserve to pronunciation, but the original voiced sound
  \textipa{[Z]} does not exist in Danish.  While the soft G
  probably deserves several different tengwar, it is suggested to lump
  it all into unqu\"e \Tunque.\label{noteG}
\item Th only appear in names, where it is pronounced as T and written
  with extended tinco \Textendedtinco.  The th\'ul\"e sound
  \textipa{[T]} does not exist in Danish.\label{noteTH}
\item J is pronounced as consonant Y in English, and written with anna
  \Tanna.  The letter combination ai and ei has in modern orthography
  been replaced with aj and ej, but still appears in names with the
  same pronunciation.  They can therefore be written as two vowels or
  with anna, according to taste: The name \emph{Mai} is
  \Tmalta\Ttelco\TTthreedots\Ttelco\TTdot ~or \Tmalta\Tanna\TTdot
  ~whereas the month \emph{maj} is written
  \Tmalta\Tanna\TTdot.\label{noteJ}
\item The sound \textipa{[S]} appears in German-derived names starting
  with Sch, in a few borrowed words with sh-, and in a few word like
  \emph{chokolade}.  It can be written with aha:
  \Taha\Tquesse\TTrightcurl\Tlambe\TTrightcurl\Tanto\TTthreedots\TTdotbelow.
  Other cases of ch are rare, and are mostly the same sound as tj
  \textipa{[tS]} (often even with a choice in orthography), both are
  written with calma \Tcalma.\label{noteAhaCalma}  \emph{Tjekkiet}
  \Tcalma\Tquesse\TTacute\TTdoubler\Ttelco\TTdot\Ttinco\TTacute\Ts (Czechia).
\item S and C: S is written with silm\"e, or silm\"e nuquerna if that
  makes theta placement more convenient, but should never be written
  with silm\"e nuquerna if there is no tetha. At the end of the word
  an s-hook (sa-rinc\"e) can be used, if desired. S is never voiced,
  and therefore never written with ess\"e.  C is quite rare, and
  can be pronounced [k] or [s] and is written with quesse or silm\"e
  nuquerna, respectively.  Silm\"e nuquerna without a tetha will thus
  be C, with a tetha it is with high probability an s.  \emph{Cirkus}:
  \Tsilmenuquerna\Toore\TTdot\Tquesse\Tsilmenuquerna\TTrightcurl.\label{noteCS}
  The letter Z is pronounced exactly like S in Danish, but should still
  be written with ess\"e or ess\"e nuquerna.
\item Hv: Words starting with hv are written with hwesta sindarinwa,
  although the h is completely silent.  This is to acknowledge the
  common origin and almost one-to-one mapping with the wh- words in
  English (e.g. hvad \Thwestasindarinwa\Tanto\TTthreedots ~= what,
  hvor  = where, hvid = white).\label{noteHv}
\item Hj: Words starting with hj are written with halla anna as the H
  is completely silent.  No single tengwa is used here, as there is no
  mapping to similar words in other languages where a single tengwa
  would be used.  In the contrary, these words map almost one-to-one
  to Icelandic (close to Old Norse), where hj is pronounced as two
  joined consonant sounds (hard to pronounce for non-Icelanders).
  Presumably, Icelandic elves would write these words with hyarmen
  anna, which is shifted to halla anna in Danish to reflect that the H
  is silent.  Other words with silent h are also written with halla
  instead of hyarmen.\label{notehalla}
\item W is not officially in the Danish alphabet, but is common in
  names where it is pronounced as V.  Nevertheless, it makes sense to
  distinguish.  Vala can also be used for the rare u-glide diphtongs:
  \emph{Laura:} \Tlambe\Tvala\TTthreedots\Troomen\Ttelco\TTthreedots.\label{noteW}
\item The Danish mode follows the r-rule: \'or\"e is used before a
  consonant and at the end of the word, r\'omen is used before a
  vowel.  A following word starting with a vowel does \emph{not}
  change a final \'or\"e to r\'omen, as it does not change the
  rhoticity of the r (Danish r's are in general not very rhotic).\label{noteR}
\item Compound words: Terms consisting of multiple nouns in English
  are compound words in Danish (office chair, mobile phone, \ldots).
  Although it is a travesty to write such words with a hypen in
  Danish, the compoundness should be respected when writing with
  tengwar: A final vowel (or nasal sound) from one part does not
  ``climb onto'' the first consonant of the following part.
  \emph{Kanotur} (canoe trip) is
  \Tquesse\Tnuumen\TTthreedots\Ttelco\TTrightcurl
  \Ttinco\Toore\TTleftcurl ~not
  \Tquesse\Tnuumen\TTthreedots\Ttinco\TTrightcurl\Toore\TTleftcurl\Ts
  (Hmm, I am in doubt about this rule).
\item English loan words and names are written according to the
  English mode, if the original pronunciation is approximately
  retained.  \emph{Jane} is written
  \Tanga\Tnuumen\TTthreedots\TTdotbelow ~or
  \Tanna\Tnuumen\TTthreedots\Ttelco\TTacute, depending on how she
  pronounces it.
